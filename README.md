# VMware-vSphere-Lab-Projects

This repository documents a series of hands-on labs completed as part of the **41891 Cloud Computing Infrastructure** course. The labs cover the end-to-end process of building a virtualised data center from the ground up using VMware vSphere 7.

The project demonstrates core competencies in virtualisation, centralised management, shared storage, network segmentation, and high availabilityâ€”all critical skills for roles in Cloud Engineering, Systems Administration, and Cybersecurity Infrastructure.

### Labs Overview
